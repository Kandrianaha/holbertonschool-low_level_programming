# holbertonschool-low_level_programming

Welcome to the **holbertonschool-low_level_programming** repository!  
This project contains coursework, exercises, and projects focusing on low-level programming concepts in C, as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Description

This repository is dedicated to exploring the fundamentals of low-level programming, primarily using the C programming language.  
It includes source code, exercises, and projects that demonstrate concepts such as memory management, data structures, algorithms, and interaction with the operating system.

## Contents

Youâ€™ll find folders and files corresponding to different topics and projects, such as:

- **Hello, World!**: Introduction to C and basic syntax.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding primitive data types, variables, and constants.
- **Control Structures**: If statements, loops, and switches.
- **Functions**: Declaring, defining, and using functions in C.
- **Pointers and Arrays**: Exploring pointers, arrays, and their memory management.
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
- **More Advanced Projects**: Sorting algorithms, searching, and other fundamental computer science concepts.

The organization typically follows the Holberton School project directory structure.
